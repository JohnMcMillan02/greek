## Using, building and test

`greek` is compiled for both the JVM and ScalaJS using scala versions 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12.  Binaries for all platforms are available from jcenter.

If you are using sbt, include `Resolver.jcenterRepo` in your list of resolvers

    resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo

and add this to your library dependencies:

    "edu.holycross.shot" %% "greek" % VERSION

For maven, ivy or gradle equivalents, refer to <https://bintray.com/neelsmith/maven/greek>.

To build from source and test, use normal sbt commands (`compile`, `test` ...).
